#### Round 1 
It was an video call interview round. Team shared a code sharing document and it won't compile the code. You code should be logically correct. 

Questions :
Figure out the local minima in the array. Expected time complexity was - O(logn)

I forget the second question.

#### Round 2 
(Video call interview - Amazon chime)
Design a framework that we read variable and it's format and convert it into another format. Design should be extensible.

E.g. convert 'myVar' to 'my_var'
     convert myVar to 'MY_VAR'
