## Each round
Time limit : 45 mins
Expectations : Solve the problem and code program. 

## Round1 - Basic DS round
Most of the question were single line answer type questions. Few I remember are like :
1. Which sorting algo is best for sorting already sorted array ?
2. What is worst case complexity of merge or quick sort and why?
3. Which traversal approch you will use for traveling directed or undirected graph ?

## Round 2 - Hangout call
* Find maximum sum in an array s.t. no two elements are adjacent. 
* Given a tree, find maximum diameter in tree s.t all elements of that are accending or decending order. 

## Round 3 - DS algo. 
* Given an 2D array, you have to squash it s.t. order along the row and order along the col remains maintained. 

## Round 4 - DS algo
* A manager can have many subordinates and they can again further have subordinates. Now manager pass information to their 
subordinates and infomration to each subordinate get passed in different amount of time. Find maximum amount of the time in which infomation 
will be passed to each of the employee. 

Constraint :
A person can have more than one manager. (Problem won't be solved with tree approch)

## Round 5 - System design
Design youtube. 

## Round 6 - DS algo
A map is represented as arrangement of small box and you have to walk along the edges of small box. 

There are Users and GBikes and each have their cordinates.

So, distance between a GBike and a User will be `Math.abs(Gbike.x - User.x) + Math.abs(Gbike.y - User.y)`. 
Note : This information is not mentioned in the question.

There are n Users and m GBikes. You have to assign Gbike to users s.t. each user gets the best bike. 

What does best bike means ?
Which is closer to a user but it should not be more closer to any other user. 

## Round 7 - DS algo
Given an array of number in array which represents the heigh of the buildings. 

Arrange the building heights st. if you are looking from the left only k building are visible.

Now you have given two numbers - n and k. Find out possible arrangements s.t. only k buildings are visible.
